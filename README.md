# Cats-Vs-Dogs-Classification-Using-CNN
This Project is based on CNN Algorithm (Binary Class) where we have Taken Dataset of DOGs and Cats from Kaggle 
CNNs are a class of deep learning algorithms ideally suited for image recognition and classification tasks. They mimic the organization of the animal visual cortex and are capable of automatically learning spatial hierarchies of features from raw image data. This hierarchical feature learning makes CNNs highly effective in capturing intricate patterns and representations within images.

The dataset consists of a diverse collection of images featuring various breeds of dogs and cats in different poses and environments. Each image is labeled as either a dog or a cat, forming the basis of the binary classification problem.

The project involves several key steps:

1) Data Preprocessing: The images are preprocessed to ensure uniformity in size, color, and format. This step may also involve data augmentation techniques such as rotation, flipping, and scaling to enhance the diversity of the training dataset and improve model generalization.
2) Model Architecture Design: A CNN architecture is designed, comprising multiple layers of convolutional, pooling, and fully connected layers. These layers work together to extract relevant features from the input images and make predictions.
3) Training: The designed CNN model is trained on the preprocessed dataset. During training, the model adjusts its parameters iteratively to minimize the discrepancy between predicted outputs and ground truth labels.
4) Evaluation: The trained model is evaluated on a separate validation dataset to assess its performance in terms of accuracy, precision, recall, and other relevant metrics.
5) Testing: Finally, the model is tested on a held-out test dataset to evaluate its generalization ability and readiness for deployment in real-world applications.
